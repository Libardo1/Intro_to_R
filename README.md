# Intro_to_R
Materials for an Introductory Short Course on the R Language and Environment for Statistical Computing and Graphics.


This course is still under development, for best results please download a Git Client and clone this repository (see the GitHub help pages for instructions on how to do this).

A clone of this repository will allow you to receive my updates to these materials as I make them via Git rather than having to download them manually from the repository page each time you want the new version.

If you're in a hurry and want to start the current version of the course right now feel free to scroll to the 'Download Zip' button on the right hand side of the 'Intro_to_R' repository homepage <https://github.com/brfitzpatrick/Intro_to_R> (if you're reading this online chances are you are at this page now).

Once you have the Repository downloaded as a Zip file please extract it somewhere on your hard drive, the course begins with Module 1: '1_Basics.R'.

For best results please install the current realse of R <http://cran.r-project.org/> and the current version of the RStudio IDE (Desktop Version) <http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desk> then open the file '1_Basics.R' with RStudio.
