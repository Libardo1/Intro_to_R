# Intro_to_R
Materials for an Introductory Short Course on the R Language and Environment for Statistical Computing and Graphics.

Congratulations on your interest in learning to use the R Language and Environment for Statistical Computing and thank you for your interest in this short course!

This course is still under development, for ease of use I highly recommend downloading a Git Client and cloning this repository (see the GitHub help pages for instructions on how to do this).

A clone of this repository will allow you to receive my updates to the materials this repository contains as I make them via Git rather than having to download them manually from the repository page each time you want the new version.

If you're in a hurry and want to start the current version of the course right now please scroll to the 'Download Zip' button on the right hand side of the 'Intro_to_R' repository homepage <https://github.com/brfitzpatrick/Intro_to_R> (if you're reading this online chances are you are at this page now).

Once you have the Repository downloaded as a Zip file please extract it somewhere on your hard drive, the course begins with Module 1: '1_Basics.R'.

For best results please install the current realse of R <http://cran.r-project.org/> and the current version of the RStudio IDE (Desktop Version) <http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desk> then open the file '1_Basics.R' with RStudio.

All the best with your journey into the free and open source statistical software that is R.

These course materials are also free and open source, please see the LICENSE file included in this repository for details.
